# Python Playground

This repo serves as a 6 week challenge to get up to speed learning Python.
The format and weekly code challenges were developed using ChatGPT and written by yours truly. The core resource for learning
Python concepts was [the Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).

*Note the code isn't necessary friendly towards beginner developers.* This challenge was done in the context of a seasoned
backend developer applying OOP patterns and package best-practices in Python.
